## Potential Revenue Streams
- Subscription model for parents
- Affiliate model for bigger providers (e.g. YMCA, BSA, etc.)
- Once we hit critical mass in terms of the user base, we could start to sell products to camp/activity providers.


## Open Questions:
- What's the MVP that would be good enough for a user like KP to download and use the product?
  - Would V1 need to allow for enrolling directly through the product?   Current mocks has a note about how you have to go enroll at the provider's site, but will that be acceptable for MVP? 
- Are we thinking too narrowly by focusing on "camps"?   Would parents want to use this for managing activities year around?  For example, keeping track of sports league schedules (e.g. "when is baseball season and what's deadline to sign up for parks and rec leagues?")  Perhaps we start with camps and then over time expand to be a holistic planner for everything your kid is doing outside of school, year around.   This might also include things like lessons (e.g. swim lessons, piano lessons, etc.), tutoring, etc.


## Things I'm Liking About this Idea
- If we made the features related to coordinating with other parents (e.g. see what camps your kids friends are doing, coordinate pickup/dropoffs, etc.), that could organically drive adoption (aka get the mom’s out there marketing for us)
- having kids is a pita, so a product that helps make it less of a PITA is probably something ppl would be happy to pay money for
- seems like there could be some fairly obvious routes to testing the idea without needing to boil the ocean out of the gate.   For example, you can go really deep on 1-2 geos (e.g. Boulder and Marin County) first.   Cuz the biggest challenge is goign to be dealing with a million different formats for integrations and data sources.   but with just a couple deep geos you can solve the empty restaurant process and even just use a spreadsheet to populate all the camps if u needed to at first
- there’s probably a referral traffic play here.   for example, I bet the YMCA will pay you if you help them get butts in seats.
- summer camps makes sense as a starting point (sounds like summer is when this pain point is most acute), but seems like there’s natural expansion oppy to more year-around activities.   For example, keeping track of sports league schedules (e.g. “when is baseball season and what’s deadline to sign up for parks and rec leagues?“)  Perhaps we would start with camps and then over time expand to be a holistic planner for everything your kid is doing outside of school, year around.   This might also include things like lessons (e.g. swim lessons, piano lessons, etc.), tutoring, after-school programs, etc.
